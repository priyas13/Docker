# Docker
Docker is used to run software packages called "containers". These containers are isolated from each-other and bundle their own application, tools, libraries and files. Containers can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. These containers are light-weight because they are run by single operating system. A container packages all the code and its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliable from one computing environment to another. 

## Image
Image is a stand-alone, lightweight, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, enviornment variables, and config files.

## Container
Container is a runtime instance of an image.
