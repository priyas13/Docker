# Docker
Docker is used to run software packages called "containers". These containers are isolated from each-other and bundle their own application, tools, libraries and files. Containers can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. These containers are light-weight because they are run by single operating system. A container packages all the code and its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliable from one computing environment to another.
